When you have botched your Arch install, for examply by writing invalid config files somewhere, it's possible to rescue your setup!

Steps are:

1. reboot
2. in grub, choose "advanced"
3. in the next menu, don't choose the option with "fallback"
4. press "e" to edit the boot configuration
5. add to the longest line (the one which starts the linux image): `systemd.unit=multi-user.target` (beware: it's querty!)
6. save & boot

Remove your changes and then reboot again
