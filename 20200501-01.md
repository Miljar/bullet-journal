After installing Arch Linux, via the great install scripts of [BlackIkeEagle](https://github.com/BlackIkeEagle/archlinux-reinstall), I wasn't able to boot into the system. Somehow GRUB wasn't added or made available in the UEFI Boot Loader. This fixed it:

```shell
$ efibootmgr --create --disk /dev/nvme0n1 --part 1 --loader /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI --label "GRUB" --verbose
```
