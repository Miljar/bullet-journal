After installing i3 and logging in for the first time, you're greeted with a prompt to create config. If you have a config, great, skip it. I didn't have a config, so I generated a default config.

Only thing asked (if I remember correctly) is which modifier key (here after `$mod`) you want to use: `alt` (default, but may conflict with other programs) or `win` (maybe better to avoid conflicts). I chose `win`.

After the config is generated, first thing you probably want to do is launch a browser and continue looking up i3 stuff.

* Launching a program: `$mod + d`, type the program, like "firefox" and hit `enter` to launch it.
* Launching a terminal: `$mod + enter`
