To invert scrolling (natural scroll) and tap-to-click, an Xorg configuration file should be added `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d`. The "standard" way of naming the file would be `30-touchpad.conf`. If it doesn't exist, create it, with following content:

```shell
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "touchpad"
    Driver "libinput"
    MatchIsTouchpad "on"
    Option "NaturalScrolling" "true"
    Option "Tapping" "on"
    Option "TappingButtonMap" "lmr"
EndSection
```

So what do the options mean?

* `NaturalScrolling` = inverted scrolling, as introduced by macos I think
* `Tapping` = allow tapping on the touchpad
* `TappingButtonMap` = mapping 1-2-3 fingers to l-m-r buttons on a mouse (l = left, m = middle, r = right)

Might want to change "lmr" to "lrm" in the future though.
