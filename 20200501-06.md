i3 uses a tree structure to organize things. Main concepts are: workspace, container, window.

As I currently understand or interpret it, a program is opened in a window. Multiple windows are grouped in a container. A container can have a layout (how windows are organized). A container is always part of a workspace. A workspace can have multiple containers.

Default container layout is split. So each program you launch is a new window in either a vertical split or a horizontal split. To choose between vertical or horizontal: `$mod + v` (vertical) or `$mod + h` before launching a program.

There are other layouts available: tabbed and stacked. To switch between them:

* Split layout: `$mod + e`
* Stacked layout: `$mod + s`
* Tabbed layout: `$mod + z`

Just like Vim has multiple modes (insert, delete, visual, normal, ...), i3 has multiple modes for new windows: tiling and floating.

Floating is what you're used to from other window managers. Tiling is what you want to use i3 for. To switch between them: `$mod + shift + space`

Changing focus between windows: use the mouse (FROWN!) or like Vim `$mod + j/k/l/m` (replace j/k/l/m with arrow keys. FROWN again, but I do it anyway).

Rotate windows in tiling mode: `$mode + shift + j/k/l/m`. This moves windows.
